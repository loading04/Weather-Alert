# Weather Alert
 This code retrieves weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API for a specific location, formats the data, and sends it as an SMS message using the Twilio API. It starts by importing the required modules, requests and twilio, and initializes the authentication tokens for the Twilio account.  The code then specifies the latitude, longitude, and units for the weather data request, and sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API. The response is stored in JSON format and processed to retrieve the weather information for the next 12 hours (4 time intervals with 3-hour increments).  The retrieved weather information is then formatted into a string that includes the time, temperature, feels-like temperature, and weather condition for each of the 3-hour intervals. Finally, this formatted string is sent as an SMS message using the Twilio API, to the phone number specified in the 'to' field of the 'message' object.
